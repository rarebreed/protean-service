    "## Memory allocations\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important things to understand when designing code that performs well is to understand how memory is allocated and deallocated.  The fallacy that garbage collected languages promise, is that \"you don't have to worry about memory (de)allocation\".  But this really isn't true.  GC'ed languages still pay a price:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easier memory leaks\n",
    "- Poor performing code to to lots of memory copying\n",
    "- Unsuitable to deterministic runtimes due to garbage collection pauses\n",
    "\n",
    "System's program languages do not necessarily solve these problems with a silver bullet.  But they give you the tools to do so unlike GC'ed languages.\n",

    "## Stack and heap\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to understand the stack and the heap when working with rust, and the earlier you understand this concept the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many modern languages do not make a distinction between the stack and heap, so this may be a new concept.  The stack is a region that the Operating System uses to execute instructions of your program.  When you define a function, room has to be made on the stack for the arguments, and when the function exits, all the previously allocated elements on the stack are popped off and the return value is pushed onto the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why recursive functions can `stack overflow`, because on each new function call, room for the arguments of the function are pushed onto the stack, and if this happens too much before the recursion stops, the stack space can be fully consumed (because the Operating System has a limit on how big the stack space is, and this is determined by the kernel when it is built usually)\n",
