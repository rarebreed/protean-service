# Preface

For a very long time, I have wanted to tell a story.  Over the years, the crux of the story changed. 20 years ago, I 
wanted to tell the story about mankind's march to transhumanism, and how humanity would deal with the idea that humans
were no longer the top dog.  I concocted in my head, how the future would develop so that we would have quantum 
computers and fully synthetic human beings.  I was very much inspired by 2 things:

- the newly emergent transhuman science fiction stories
- The Gulf War and the social factors backing it

In transhuman sci-fi, I saw a very basic and fundamental question: "What does it mean to be human?".  I saw this against
the backdrop of the Iraq and Afghan wars, which, in my opinion, was engulfed in a new religious confrontation.  While
I sketched out some ideas, I never really was able to fully form exactly what it was I wanted to tell.  Sure, asking
what it means to be human is an interesting question, but I couldn't figure out how to frame it into a story arc and
how it could be told.

As I got older, and dived deeper into esoteric religion, I slowly began to ask a more fundamental question...at least of
myself.  It was a question I first asked myself when I was 17 but had forgotten.  I will not say what this question is,
because I want the reader to discover this on their own reading the story.  But what I will say is this: people are
yearning for something deeper and more profound in their lives.

## The great yearning

Have you ever wondered why Star Wars became such a phenomenon, and why to some degree, the recent movies have failed?
The same could be asked of Star Trek.  Another example that comes to mind is Avatar, the Last Airbender.  I believe that
people deep down feel that something is missing in their lives.  There is a hole inside that yearns to be filled.  But
what can fill this metaphysical hole is not clear.

In Star Wars, people were fascinated by the Jedi and the Force: quasi-religous notions of spirituality and good vs evil.
In Star Trek, the main theme is that humans have somehow been able to overcome all the foibles of humanity's dark
nature, conquering greed, selfishness, personal power, and replaced it with a burning desire to explore and discover.
In Avatar, the mystical powers of bending took on spiritual overtones, much as the Jedi in Star Wars, but even more
obviously grounded in real earth religions.

I looked back at other powerful storylines that have intrigued myself and others.  I thought of Star Trek Voyager, and
Battlestar Galactica, and how in some ways, they are 2 sides of the same coin.  In both storylines, there is the goal to
"come home" again.  In the former, a hapless crew is flung far away into the unknown, and the brave crew must find their
way home again, though at least they know where home is.  In Battlestar Galactica, death is stalking them, and the rag
tag survivors do not even know if "home" exists (well, actually, only Adama knows this).  This is a very powerful call
for me, this idea of coming home again.  Even one of my favorite songs of all time is Phil Collins _Take Me Home_. But
why?  Why is this a powerful theme?

Deep down, I think we are all lost and we desperately trying to find our home again whether we realize it or not.

## Lost

In today's world, religion is supposed to be what connects us to a "higher power".  Indeed, the word religion itself
comes from latin _religiare_ which means to "bind together".  I have this great sense that we are like little children
who have lost their parents.  We do not know how to find home, and we do not even know where we are anymore.  Many
people in today's world feel marginalized and have great doubts about religion or are not religious at all.  Even those
who say that they are religious still suffer, and they claim that their faith gives them strength...but still they
suffer just as everyone else does.

This sense of being lost is one of the main tenets of the story, and hence why the story itself is called _The Lost_.
While making people realize they are lost is a major revelation in itself, it can't be all that the story is about.
The journey to find our way back home is at least as important.

## The world

I have long been fighting over the kind of world to put this story in.  The three major kinds I have are:

- A fantasy world, albeit one that is mostly realistic
- Our own real world, perhaps in an alternate past or present
- A not too distant future that is realistic

One thing however is certain: I do not want this world to have any supernatural powers.  As I wrote in the readme to the
project, I wanted to have a world without fantastic powers.  A world where training, your principles and your actions
left your mark on the world.  While there might be some _preternatural_ powers, for example heightened senses, body
control (ie, toleration of cold or heat) and other above normal human talents might be displayed, it is nevertheless
based on at least plausible reality.  If this was fantasy, it would be more Conan than D&D.  If it was sci-fi, it would
be more Traveller 2300AD than Starfinder.

The world also had to feel familiar, and yet also different.  If the world is too different, then it faces at least two
different problems:

- There's a disconnect between our own world and the fictional world
- It requires more supposition and backfill to explain how the world works

The latter part can be a boon too in some ways, as it allows one to craft the world you want including all the back
story and history needed to explain the rationale of the world.  The trick I think, is to create a world that we readers
can relate to.  I think one of the great strengths of the Star Trek universe compared to Star Wars, is that it could be
real at some distant point in our future.  This is the great strength of science fiction, as it gives us a chance to
imagine how _we could be_.

But, for this story, I want the reader to reflect on _where we are_ and _how we got here_.  I have often said, you can't
know where you are going unless you know where you are, and you can't know where you are, unless you know where you have
been.  I'm also fond of a saying of Lao Tzu who said:

```
If you are suffering, you are thinking of the past.
If you are worrying, you are thinking of the future.
If you are are thinking in the present, you will be at peace.
```

As such, I ruled out a futuristic world, because to be quite honest, I'm not sure humanity has much of a future left.
If anything, that's another message I want to get across.

So that leaves us with a fantasy world or an alternate history world.  Why not both?  A world based in history, but not
quite of it is appealing.  

## The Setting and theme

There are a couple of themes that have interested me, and I would like to explore them with the game.

- Finding your way home (think Voyager or Battlestar Galactica)
- Being hunted and pursued (think BSG, Star Wars and Avatar the Last Airbender)
- Student/Master relationship (think Avatar, the Jedis, Karate Kid)
- Loss of way of life
    - by force (American Indians, Meiji era Japan)
    - by techno shock (Industrial revolution, Information revolution, Bio revolution)

The setting will be a low-magic fantasy world.  By low-magic, it doesn't mean that the magic is not powerful.  Rather,
it means that the magic is difficult, rare, and time consuming.  Think Lord of the Rings rather than D&D.  Having a low
magic world gives us two features:

- People are still people, and can't rely on fancy magical powers much if at all
- Magic becomes truly something special because it is rare
- It gives a way to introduce things in the world which would not otherwise be possible

The actual setting is loosely based on 1600s Malaysia and Indonesia.  This was an area and era interesting for a couple
of reasons. The Dutch and Spanish had recently just invaded and the entire region was a potpurri of cultures and
religions.  There was the older Majapahit and Sri Vijayan empires in the Malay archipelago, but there were the
neighboring Chams of Vietnam, the Angkors in Cambodia and the "savage" Filipinos (NB, I am part pinoy, so no flames
please...AFAWK, the Filipinos didn't have a strong central empire before the Spaniards arrived).  There were also
Annamese from Vietnam, the Mandarins from China, the Chola from India and Arabic traders.  Buddhism and Hinduism were
slowly dying out, being forced out by Islam from Indian and Arabic traders.  And let's not forget the arrival of the
Europeans as future colonizers.

I also wanted, for a specific reason, to _not_ have a white ethnocentric culture and setting.  These settings have been
done to death.  For that matter, so have Japanese and to a lesser degree Chinese settings.  Very few people know about
any of the other Asiatic cultures.  And even the Japanese or Chinese based settings don't truly give a flavor of
Shintoism, Zen/Chan or Taoism.  I think this is a great tragedy.  There is a lot we could learn from these other
cultures and religions.

In fact, I think a huge reason Star Wars was so popular, was it was the first mainstream movie that exposed a Western
audience to a mystic "religion" that was primarily based on Buddhism and Taoism.  The setting will have its own version
of Jedis, and in fact, more than one version.

### About being woke

I will endeavor to be socially sensitive for the setting and game.  This is not because I am afraid of SJW police
beating down my door, but simply because I want to show how we're all in this together.  That being said, I might say
some things that do offend others.  This is not intentional.  I would ask you to also realize that it's impossible to
appeal to everyone, and being offended is ultimately owned by the person feeling offended.

There is a great story about the Buddha, where the Buddha gets insulted by a Brahman zealot.  Basically, the Buddha
just listens, and then asks the Brahman if he has a guest, and the guest does not take the food that is offered.  What
happens to the food that is not taken?  The Brahman said that the food will come back to him.  So the Buddha said, it is
with insults

```
In the same way, Brahmin, that with which you have insulted me, who is not insulting; that with which you have taunted 
me, who is not taunting; that with which you have berated me, who is not berating: that I don't accept from you. It's 
all yours, Brahmin. It's all yours. 
```

The Brahman then said that even so, the Buddha still got angry, even if the Buddha did not insult him back.  To which
the Buddha replied

```
Whence is there anger
for one free from anger, tamed, living in tune
one released through right knowing, calmed and Such.

You make things worse when you flare up at someone who is angry.
Whoever doesn't flare up at someone who's angry
wins a battle hard to win.

You live for the good of both 
your own and others 
when, knowing the other is provoked, 
you mindfully grow calm.

When you work the cure of both
your own and others
those who think you a fool
know nothing of Dhamma. 
```

If you feel insulted at something someone says, this says as much about you, as it does the insulter.  Yes, this is a 
difficult practice, but it is one we must cultivate in today's world.

### The Factions

Every setting has to have its factions.  These can be the major players at a very large scale, like countries or empires
but they can also be religious affiliations, or schools of thought which can transcend borders.  Factions can also be
comprised of Orders which are divisions within the faction.  Here is a basic listing of the major factions and orders.

The major factions:
