# Preface

For a very long time, I have wanted to tell a story.  Over the years, the crux of the story changed. 20 years ago, I 
wanted to tell the story about mankind's march to transhumanism, and how humanity would deal with the idea that humans
were no longer the top dog.  I concocted in my head, how the future would develop so that we would have quantum 
computers and fully synthetic human beings.  I was very much inspired by 2 things:

- the newly emergent transhuman science fiction stories
- The Gulf War and the social factors backing it

In transhuman sci-fi, I saw a very basic and fundamental question: "What does it mean to be human?".  I saw this against
the backdrop of the Iraq and Afghan wars, which, in my opinion, was engulfed in a new religious confrontation.  While
I sketched out some ideas, I never really was able to fully form exactly what it was I wanted to tell.  Sure, asking
what it means to be human is an interesting question, but I couldn't figure out how to frame it into a story arc and
how it could be told.

As I got older, and dived deeper into esoteric religion, I slowly began to ask a more fundamental question...at least of
myself.  It was a question I first asked myself when I was 17 but had forgotten.  I will not say what this question is,
because I want the reader to discover this on their own reading the story.  But what I will say is this: people are
yearning for something deeper and more profound in their lives.

## The great yearning

Have you ever wondered why Star Wars became such a phenomenon, and why to some degree, the recent movies have failed?
The same could be asked of Star Trek.  Another example that comes to mind is Avatar, the Last Airbender.  I believe that
people deep down feel that something is missing in their lives.  There is a hole inside that yearns to be filled.  But
what can fill this metaphysical hole is not clear.

In Star Wars, people were fascinated by the Jedi and the Force: quasi-religous notions of spirituality and good vs evil.
In Star Trek, the main theme is that humans have somehow been able to overcome all the foibles of humanity's dark
nature, conquering greed, selfishness, personal power, and replaced it with a burning desire to explore and discover.
In Avatar, the mystical powers of bending took on spiritual overtones, much as the Jedi in Star Wars, but even more
obviously grounded in real earth religions.

I looked back at other powerful storylines that have intrigued myself and others.  I thought of Star Trek Voyager, and
Battlestar Galactica, and how in some ways, they are 2 sides of the same coin.  In both storylines, there is the goal to
"come home" again.  In the former, a hapless crew is flung far away into the unknown, and the brave crew must find their
way home again, though at least they know where home is.  In Battlestar Galactica, death is stalking them, and the rag
tag survivors do not even know if "home" exists (well, actually, only Adama knows this).  This is a very powerful call
for me, this idea of coming home again.  Even one of my favorite songs of all time is Phil Collins _Take Me Home_. But
why?  Why is this a powerful theme?

Deep down, I think we are all lost and we desperately trying to find our home again whether we realize it or not.

## Lost

In today's world, religion is supposed to be what connects us to a "higher power".  Indeed, the word religion itself
comes from latin _religiare_ which means to "bind together".  I have this great sense that we are like little children
who have lost their parents.  We do not know how to find home, and we do not even know where we are anymore.  Many
people in today's world feel marginalized and have great doubts about religion or are not religious at all.  Even those
who say that they are religious still suffer, and they claim that their faith gives them strength...but still they
suffer just as everyone else does.

This sense of being lost is one of the main tenets of the story, and hence why the story itself is called _The Lost_.
While making people realize they are lost is a major revelation in itself, it can't be all that the story is about.
The journey to find our way back home is at least as important.

## Mysticism and reality

I have long been fighting over the kind of world to put this story in.  The three major I have are:

- A fantasy world, albeit one that is mostly realistic
- Our own world, perhaps in the past or today
- A not too distant future that is realistic

One thing however is certain: I do not want this world to have any supernatural powers.  As I wrote in the readme to the
project, I wanted to have a world without fantastic powers.  A world where training, your principles and your actions
left your mark on the world.  While there might be some preternatural _powers_, for example heightened senses, body
control (ie, toleration of cold or heat) and other above normal human talents might be displayed, it is nevertheless
based on at least plausible reality.  If this was fantasy, it would be more Conan than D&D.  If it was sci-fi, it would
be more Traveller 2300AD than Starfinder.

The world also had to feel familiar, and yet also different.

I'll go ahead and toss out the 2nd one.  While there is some appeal to setting the story in our world.  While I could
have tweaked it to have been in the past, I don't believe our current world would work, at least, not without some
catastrophic event to alter the course of history.
