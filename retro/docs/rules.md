# retro rules

Maybe it's just me, but have RPG games become text books?  For all the talk about "rules-lite" games, it astounds me
that I have to read through paragraphs od exposition and explanation for how to create and adjudicate storytelling
conflicts in a shared narrative.  All this emphasis on "story-driven" actually feels more complex than the simulation
style rules with crunch that it is supposed to replace.  

The metagaming aspects I think have also gotten out of control.  I am ok with some limited  "get out of dying" card,
but I am more of the old school camp that story is driven by character actions and consequences that were taken given
the situation that the GM created.  The shared story comes from choices and consequences, not some metagaming elements.

Also, a lot of the verbosity of rules explanation is due, ironically, to their simplicity.  Because many rules systems
are not granular enough, and dont cover a lot of options, the rules start to explode with exceptions or special one off
cases.  Due to the lack of more detail in the rules, more exposition and examples are needed for clarity as well.

So the irony is that more "complicated" rules, that are more detailed and have more factors can in the long run be
simpler than the simpler rules which require so many special cases and explanations of how to handle things. 

## Holistic rules

The philosophy of retro is that the "complexity" is there for a reason.  It is there to help reduce arbitrary adjudication
and it also provides constraints.  I have often marvelled at the parallels between the programming world and the role
playting community.  One thing we learned about programming was that dynamically programmed languages are great for
