# An RPG for a more uncivilized age

A game for more sobering times

## Solidarity with Ukraine

I write this segment on the 10th day after Russia invaded the Ukraine.  I also write this after looking at Free League
Publishing's Twilight 2000 4th edition release.  I can't help but think of two things:

- The 2nd Cold War has started
- We need a game to simulate what's going on there with better representation than what is on the market

All of these rules-lite systems are a bit of a joke to me now.  Putting narrative as a meta gaming resource rather than 
letting it evolve naturally from choices is not just wrong from a gaming point of view, but I think a failure in how we 
view the world around us.  The truth is, we often don't have control in life.  We have to play the cards we were dealt 
with.  But in our society, we want to bend everything to our will.  We want our voices heard, our heroes (imagined or
real) to be represented, and above all, we want everything in our lives (or games) to make sense and have it seemingly 
under control.  But life just doesn't want to oblige.

People think simulating life will be either boring at best, or tragic at worst.  Afterall, people game to escape cold
hard reality right?  And yet, when I was younger, we played WW3 games all the time.  We met the possibility of our
lives turning upside down head on.  We wondered....what if?  

The Ukrainians don't have the luxury of shared collaborative storytelling.  Their lives are unfolding in ways that they
do not want and in ways unimagineable to us sitting comfortably in our chairs.  And yet, we are enraptured by their
story, by their sacrifice and heroism.  This is not some elf taking on a balrog, this is what real heroism looks like.
Their story captivates us _despite_ it being a cold hard and ugly reality.  This is the point I want to get across with
retro.  We have to learn that things are beyond our control, and we have to deal with it.  It is _because_ we don't
have control that our story is enhanced, not in spite of it.

There is no rules-lite in real life, and yet real life tells us the best stories.  There is no "I want to guide the 
story this way" other than how you grasp the horns of life and grapple with it as best as you can.  We have forgotten
how to accept things as they are, and instead try to cheat not only our games, but our very lives.  

The retro game was envisioned as a return to old school rules where story is a consequence of actions that the players
make on the stage that the GM makes.  There are no meta game rules to bend the story to your will.  But more importantly
the _meaning_ of the story is a epiphenomenon that arises from what the _players_ take away from it.  

## What is retro?

So, what's so special about retro?  Is this some old-skool OD&D clone?  To explain what retro is, and the audience this
game is catering to, I need to tell a little story first.

I actually haven't played a role-playing session in close to 30 years now.  My gaming career technically started back
around 1980 at the ripe old age of 8.  My father was an avid historical miniatures gamer, and my older brother had
started to play some games including this new fangled D&D.  I was more curious about what my father and older brother
were doing rather than actually wanting to play myself.  But I was curious enough that I asked my parents to buy me the
Dungeon Master's Guide, Player's Handbook, Monster Manual, and Deities and Demigods.  While a lot of the text went over
my head, I was especially enraptured by Deities and Demigods and the Monster Manual.  However, I only got to play about
2 or 3 sessions with some of my friends around the 3rd grade.  I have no recollection of what we played (I do recall
that I was the DM), but it must have been enjoyable.

Fast forward to 1982, and I started playing American Civil War miniatures with my father and his gaming group.  I also
started playing some Napoleonics era wargames a little after this time, and also occasionally played some "modern" micro
armor (I don't even think TOW missles had come out yet as Dragon ATM were the best infantry could get). Every once
in awhile, my father's gaming group couldn't make it for some reason, so I wound up having nothing to do on weekends.

However, at the store we played at, the owner had a son who was just a year younger than myself, and we started to hang
out.  I distinctly remember looking at a tiny pocket box from Steve Jackson called Car Wars, and reading the back
thinking it sounded cool.  Eventually, a 3rd youngster about my age joined our group, and that's when we started playing
RPG's in earnest around about late 1983 or early 1984.  Ironically, we didn't start with AD&D.  Our first role playing
session was either Champions or Top Secret, with many many more games circa 1984 to 1985.  My fondest gaming memories
of this time was playing the pulp era RPG Justice Inc around about 1984, and later Twilight 2000 also in 1984.  Just to
give you an idea of what we played, here are examples I can recall off the top of my head in the halcyon days of 1983 to
1987:

- Champions
- Villains and Vigilantes
- Justice Inc
- Top Secret 1st ed
- James Bond
- Aftermath
- Bushido
- Twilight 2000 1st ed
- Traveller
- Traveller 2300
- MegaTraveller
- Battletech
- Ghostbusters
- The Morrow Project
- Marvel Super Hero RPG
- M.E.R.P: Middle Earth Role Playing
- Call of Cthulhu
- Stormbringer
- Phoenix Command
- Living Steel
- Paranoia
- Chill
- AD&D 1st edition
- Car Wars
- Recon 1st edition (by RPG games)
- Recon 2nd edition (aka Revised Recon by Palladium)
- TMNT
- Cyberpunk 1st ed (pre 2020)

I probably played scores of 1 or 2-shot games, only a few of which I can remember:

- Skyrealms of Jorune
- Boot Hill
- Runequest 1st ed
- Pirates (Yaquinto)
- Task Force Delta
- Daredevil
- Superworld
- Talislanta
- Palladium RPG

I slowly started getting out of RPG's starting around 1988.  I still played, but I guess at that point I was 16 and able
to drive, and RPG's lost some of their importance to me.  I still played once in a blue moon, but not like before. I
remember picking up Shadowrun in 1989 and playing a handful of games, but 88 was the beginning of the end. However,
probably the most memorable and enjoyable gaming sessions I ever had was in the 1988 time period.  And that's because
that's when we started playing a campaign set during the Vietnam War using Leading Edge's Phoenix Command rules.

Why was it so memorable to me?  I think it was because of its realism.  It was the only game I ever ran where the 
players were actually afraid to get into combat because of how deadly it was.  At that age, I was intensely curious 
about the Vietnam War.  When I was about 15, the movie Platoon had come out, and it deeply affected me.  I started
reading several books on the Vietnam War, including Chicken Hawk, We Were Warriors Once, and even A Bright Shining Lie.
Because the soldiers were reviled (generally speaking) when they got back home, and the horrible hypocrisy of why
America was even waging the war, it seemed tailor made for running some very interesting game sessions.

So now, I can finally come to what this game is about.  Back in the early days of roleplaying, many of the games
featured regular people in unusual circumstances.  Look at that list above and here are the games that featured
predominately normal humans without any magical, mystical or (for the most part) technological powers:

- Justice Inc
- James Bond
- Top Secret
- Aftermath
- Bushido
- Twilight 2000
- Traveller (yes, i am including this, because you didn't always have high technology)
- The Morrow Project (yes, I know they had HAAM suits and fusion reactors)
- Call of Cthulhu (sure, the monsters were supernatural and had powers, but basically the characters didnt)
- Phoenix Command
- Chill (like CoC, generally, the characters didn't have powers)
- Car Wars
- Recon 1st ed
- Recon 2nd ed

That's probably half the games I listed.  While I haven't _played_ an RPG in eons, I have still kept my nose in it, and
have been buying RPG's ever since either in dead tree or electronic formats.  What I have noticed in the last 20 years
or more, is the trend towards ubermensch with some kind of cool crazy power, whether those powers come from some kind of
magical, mystical or innate nature, or it comes from advanced technology (which as Mr. Clarke said, can become
indistinguishable from magic)

That's not what appeals to me in games, or even in watching movies.  I generally speaking love martial arts movies,
except when they go into the fantastical wuxia type stuff.  My jaw drops when I see Jackie Chan in his peak being able
to do what he does __in real__.  The same with Tony Jaa.  I am orders of magnitude more impressed with seeing this level
of skill displayed by real humans than watching some crazy FX to simulate powers.  I think the last movie or series I
enjoyed where the main story involved magical powers was the animated Avatar: The Last Airbender.  Series about high
tech is a little more palatable to me, at least because it's plausible, plus, the characters often don't have access to
their "powers".

And this trend where games cater mostly to characters having some kind of extraordinary power made me wonder:  why?  Is
the market demanding this, or is this what game designers are offering?  As I showed in the kinds of games above, close
to half the games on the market were about your _Everyman_ (albeit, probably highly skilled) facing extraordinary
circumstances.  When did RPG's have to be all about high tech or fantasy?  Perhaps I'm imagining all this, so, let's 
take a look a look at the top 20 "Hottest Items" on drivethrurpg.com right now (08/14/2020):

- Mysteries of the World: Scion
- Ancestries & Culture: Alternatives to race in 5e
- Kamigakari: God Hunters
- Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Soulbound
- BattleTech: Technical Readout Golden Century
- Star Trek Adventures: Iconic Villains
- Epic Isometric SciFi Core Set
- A Witcher's Journal
- Star Trek Adventures: Klingon Sourcebook
- Keyforge: Secrets of the Crucible
- Dissident Whispers
- Defiant RPG
- Deep Magic for 5e
- They Came from Beneath the Sea
- WFRP: Death on the Reik
- Battletech: Turning Points Hanseatic League
- Art of Wuxia Core rules
- ICRPG: think deck
- Four Against the Great Old Ones
- Dawn of the Daikaiju

Ok, so I'm only going to count the Call of Cthulhu supplements, and even that is a little bit iffy.  So, I don't think I
am imagining that the trend in gaming is to not have games with a fantastical background and characters with some kind
of powers.  Some might argue that popular games like Tales from the Loop/Flood should be counted, or maybe the Aliens
RPG (yeah it's scifi, but the humans don't really have any _powers_ beyond what we could do now). However, those are
just drops in the RPG universe bucket.  And yes, I know there's going to be a Twilight 2000 4th ed by Free League
Publishing (maybe the Swedes prefer more _realistic_ genres?)

Are we really that bored with reality as it is?  I often see in forums that people play games to "escape".  I get it.
_Reality_ sucks, and life is hard.  But does that mean we have to run away from reality?  I even question the very idea
that games should only be about "fun".

Have you ever read a good book, watched a good movie, or saw a TV series that you felt made you question things, and
helped improve your life?  Exercise isn't "fun" for many people, at least while they are doing it, but it is something
that improves your life.  Why do we limit games as _just_ entertainment?  Why can't games be provocative and motivating,
making us think about things?  Roleplaying at its core is not entertainment, it's "what if?".  I think that a big reason
that so many suffer nervousness, mental breakdowns, stress, etc, is because we have this irrational and unreal expectation
that _happiness_ is what we should all be striving for.  And isn't _fun_ a great way to achieve "happiness"?

Perhaps I'm just an oddball.  In Buddhism, seeking happiness is not what we should strive for.  Rather we should seek
understanding, which in turn begets peace.  With happiness, like all things in life, it can be taken away from you.  If
you are able to find peace, it can't be taken from you.  For me, the role playing sessions I treasured were not like
fishing tales boasting of how with only 2 HP left, I was able to slay the dragon or defeat the Lich Lord.  They came
from small moments, like watching how players would react to a little Vietnamese running up to them.  Did the little
boy have a grenade in his hands?  Why is he running towards them?  Do I shoot first, ask questions later?

It seems like we are all so desperate to feel special, to feel powerful in this crazy world, that we have forgotten that
we are all actually the same.  And that's a good thing, not a bad thing.  I feel that all this escapism and focusing on
all the cool powers is missing a huge aspect of roleplaying.  For this game, I want people to question what it would be
like, if you were in someone's shoes under those circumstances.  Some will argue that our characters are an alter-ego
and we should not confuse our own self (the player) with the character.  While perhaps that is one way to look at it, it
is not the only way.  I believe the reason many shows, books, and movies do resonate so well, is we ask ourselves, "what
would I do in his/her place?".  If we totally divorce ourselves from our characters, then what is the fundamental point?
Is it simply to escape how boring, dull, dreary, or stressful our own lives are?  Are we simply being actors, playing a
part without relating it to our real self?

So this game's focus will be about settings with little to no super or preternatural beings or powers.  If there is
magic, it will be background or something that the characters can not wield easily.  For technologically advanced
settings, there will be mind uploads (immortality), no magical nanotechnology (nanites still need energy and follow
all the rules of the universe), and as with all technology, there will be a price to pay.

What you will see, are down to earth characters, who like everyone else has to make decisions with the tools and
capabilities they have at hand.  If you think that sounds boring, then you are selling yourself short.  Heroes are not
people with amazing abilities, they are people who make tough choices in tough situations to help people in need. It is
in fact, the difficulty of what the hero faces that makes them and their action amazing, not always how they did it.

## Goals of retro

Retro has been in the back of my mind for over 25 years.  While I don't play as many games as I used to, I am still an
avid reader and buyer of games.  I still see the same designs over and over which I have become disillusioned with.
So it might be easiest to describe the things I don't like about many game systems, and how retro improves on it.

- Not granular enough in attributes
- Not granular enough in attribute ratings or skill levels
- Having artificial cut-offs (ie, divide by 5 and round up means people will get 13 instead of 15)
- Dice system that are linear in probability
- Skill systems that do not differentiate between innate and learned skills
- Complete knowledge of probability (no fog of war in determining chances)
- Initiative systems that don't factor in courage
- Initiative systems that only consider how soon a character can act, rather than how long the action takes
- Lack of personality traits to enforce and/or reward character behavior
- Character creation systems that allow choices of skills without any constraints (how did the professor get Artillery?)
- Damage systems that are ablative rather than inhibiting
- Damage systems that dont differentiate between different kinds of damage
- Systems that do not take fatigue into consideration
- Systems that claim to be generic but require reams and reams of special one-off rules
- Combat systems that lack tactical flavor (a swing is a swing)
- Weapons that all feel generic, because they don't have enough attributes that matter
- No meta gaming rules (let the dice fall where they may)
- No shared storytelling beyond the choices of the players

### Lack of Granularity in Attributes

Far too many game systems nowadays have only a handful of attributes, some as few as 3 (eg, mind, body, spirit).  This
lack of specialization leads to numerous special "advantages" to account for differentiation.  For example, suppose your
game system has Dexterity that implies both hand-eye coordination and overall body gracefulness.  So if you rank very
high in this attributes, does that mean you could be a world class surgeon and a gymnast?  Probably not, but that's 
what happens when your system is relegated to just a few attributes.

Another disadvantage of having too few attributes is that many characters start to feel the same.

#### How retro solves this

I think that many will balk when they first see how many attributes retro has.  But this amount of detail gives more
flavor and variance between characters.  It also makes it clear that a character can be lean but powerful, but lacking
in raw strength, or someone who has a superb memory, but might not be able to think outside of the box.

This solution also makes many "advantages" that most other games have become unnecessary.  You no longer need to take
a limitation or advantage on an attribute.

### Lack of Granularity in ratings and skills

Closely related to the lack of specialization of attributes, is having too narrow a range for attribute or skill ratings.
For example, some systems might have an attribute or skill range from 0-5.  But think about it, are people really only
rated in 6 buckets?  Having too narrow a range means that your probability of success also starts to get wonky, because
there's not enough variance possible when you roll dice.  The difference between an "average" rating of 2 and 5 either
becomes too small to make a noticeable difference, or too large.

#### How retro solves this

In retro, both attributes are rated from 1-20 and skills from 0-10.  This gives enough variance to make the difference
between a neophyte and a master much more clear.

### Artificial cutoffs

Many game systems use some form of artificial cut off to streamline the system.  For example the 2d20 system maxes out
the number of dice you can roll to 5.  The Hero System makes you divide some attributes by 5 (round up or down) to 
determine some other value.  The consequence of these cutoffs is it creates a min-maxers dream.  Why buy a level of 15
when a 13 will give you the same?

#### How retro solves this

Precision is always kept in retro.
