# An RPG for a more civilized age

So, what's so special about retro?  Is this some old-skool OD&D clone?  To explain what retro is, and the audience this
game is catering to, I need to tell a little story first.

I actually haven't played a role-playing session in close to 30 years now.  My gaming career technically started back
around 1980 at the ripe old age of 8.  My father was an avid historical miniatures gamer, and my older brother had 
started to play some games including this new fangled D&D.  I was more curious about what my father and older brother
were doing rather than actually wanting to play myself.  But I was curious enough that I asked my parents to buy me
the Dungeon Master's Guide, Player's Handbook, Monster Manual, and Deities and Demigods.  While a lot of the text went
over my head, I was especially enraptured by Deities and Demigods and the Monster Manual.  But I only got to play about
2 or 3 sessions with some of my friends around the 3rd grade.  I have no recollection of what we played (I do recall
that I was the DM), but it must have been enjoyable.

Fast forward to 1982, and I started playing American Civil War miniatures with my father and his gaming group.  I also
started playing some Napoleonics era wargames a little after this time, and also occasionally played some "modern" micro
armor (I don't even think TOW missles had come out yet, Dragon ATM were the best infantry could get). But every once in
awhile, my father's gaming group couldn't make it for some reason, so I wound up having nothing to do on weekends.

However, at the store we played at, the owner had a son who was just a year younger than myself, and we started to hang
out.  I distinctly remember looking at a tiny pocket box from Steve Jackson called Car Wars, and reading the back
thinking it sounded cool.  Eventually, a 3rd youngster about my age joined our group, and that's when we started playing
RPG's in earnest around about late 1983 or early 1984.  Ironically, we didn't start with AD&D.  Our first role playing
session was either Champions or Top Secret, with many many more games circa 1984 to 1985.  My fondest gaming memories
of this time was playing Justice Inc, a pulp era RPG, around about 1984, and later Twilight 2000 also in 1984.  Just to
give you an idea of what we played, this is just what I can recall off the top of my head in the halcyon days of 1983 to
1987:

- Champions
- Villains and Vigilantes
- Justice Inc
- Top Secret 1st ed
- James Bond
- Aftermath
- Bushido
- Twilight 2000 1st ed
- Traveller
- Traveller 2300
- MegaTraveller
- Battletech
- Ghostbusters
- The Morrow Project
- Marvel Super Hero RPG
- M.E.R.P: Middle Earth Role Playing
- Call of Cthulhu
- Stormbringer
- Phoenix Command
- Living Steel
- Paranoia
- Chill
- AD&D 1st edition
- Car Wars
- Recon 1st edition (by RPG games)
- Recon 2nd edition (aka Revised Recon by Palladium)
- TMNT
- Cyberpunk 1st ed (pre 2020)

I probably played scores of 1-shot games, only a few of which I can remember:

- Skyrealms of Jorune
- Boot Hill
- Runequest 1st ed
- Pirates (Yaquinto)
- Task Force Delta
- Daredevil
- Superworld
- Talislanta
- Palladium RPG

I slowly started getting out of RPG's starting around 1988.  I still played, but I guess at that point I was 16 and able
to drive, and RPG's lost some of their importance to me.  I still played once in a blue moon, but not like before. I
remember picking up Shadowrun in 1989 and playing a handful of games, but 88 was the beginning of the end. However,
probably the most memorable and enjoyable gaming sessions I ever had was in the 1988 time period.  And that's because
that's when we started playing a campaign set during the Vietnam War using Leading Edge's Phoenix Command rules.

Why was it so memorable to me?  I think it was because of its realism.  It was the only game I ever ran, where the 
players were actually afraid to get into combat because of how deadly it was.  At that age, I was intensely curious 
about the Vietnam War.  When I was about 15, the movie Platoon had come out, and it deeply affected me.  I started
reading several books on the Vietnam War, including Chicken Hawk, We Were Warriors Once, and even A Bright Shining Lie.
Because the soldiers were reviled (generally speaking) when they got back home, and the horrible hypocrisy of why
America was even waging the war, it seemed tailor made for running some very interesting game sessions.

So now, I can finally come to what this game is about.  Back in the early days of roleplaying, many of the games
featured regular people in unusual circumstances.  Look at that list above and here are the games that featured
predominately normal humans without any magical, mystical or (for the most part) technological powers:

- Justice Inc
- James Bond
- Top Secret
- Aftermath
- Bushido
- Twilight 2000
- Traveller (yes, i am including this, because you didn't always have high technology)
- The Morrow Project (yes, I know they had HAAM suits and fusion reactors)
- Call of Cthulhu (sure, the monsters were supernatural and had powers, but basically the characters didnt)
- Phoenix Command
- Chill (like CoC, generally, the characters didn't have powers)
- Car Wars
- Recon 1st ed
- Recon 2nd ed

That's probably half the games I listed.  While I haven't _played_ an RPG in eons, I have still kept my nose in it, and
have been buying RPG's ever since either in dead tree or electronic formats.  What I have noticed in the last 20 years
or more, is the trend towards ubermensch with some kind of cool crazy power, whether those powers come from some kind of
magical, mystical or innate nature, or it comes from advanced technology (which as Mr. Clarke said, can become
indistinguishable from magic)

That's not what appeals to me in games, or even in watching movies.  I generally speaking love martial arts movies,
except when they go into the fantastical wuxia type stuff.  To me, my jaw drops when I see Jackie Chan in his peak being
able to do what he does __in real__.  The same with Tony Jaa.  I am orders of magnitude more impressed with seeing this
level of skill displayed than watching some crazy FX to simulate powers.  I think the last movie or series I enjoyed
where the main story involved magical powers was the animated Avatar: The Last Airbender.  Series about high tech is a
little more palatable to me, at least because it's plausible, plus, the characters often don't have access to their
"powers".

And this trend where games cater mostly to characters having some kind of extraordinary power made me wonder:  why?  Is
the market demanding this, or is this what game designers are offering?  As I showed in the kinds of games above, close
to half the games on the market were about your _Everyman_ (albeit, probably highly skilled) facing extraordinary
circumstances.  When did RPG's have to be all about high tech or fantasy?  Perhaps I'm imagining all this, so, let's 
take a look a look at the top 20 "Hottest Items" on drivethrurpg.com right now (08/14/2020):

- Mysteries of the World: Scion
- Ancestries & Culture: Alternatives to race in 5e
- Kamigakari: God Hunters
- Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Soulbound
- BattleTech: Technical Readout Golden Century
- Star Trek Adventures: Iconic Villains
- Epic Isometric SciFi Core Set
- A Witcher's Journal
- Star Trek Adventures: Klingon Sourcebook
- Keyforge: Secrets of the Crucible
- Dissident Whispers
- Defiant RPG
- Deep Magic for 5e
- They Came from Beneath the Sea
- WFRP: Death on the Reik
- Battletech: Turning Points Hanseatic League
- Art of Wuxia Core rules
- ICRPG: think deck
- Four Against the Great Old Ones
- Dawn of the Daikaiju

Ok, so I'm only going to count the Call of Cthulhu supplements, and even that is a little bit iffy.  So, I don't think I
am imagining that the trend in gaming is to not have games with a fantastical background and characters with some kind
of powers.  Some might argue that popular games like Tales from the Loop/Flood should be counted, or maybe the Aliens
RPG (yeah it's scifi, but the humans don't really have any _powers_ beyond what we could do now). While it's true that
those games do have regular characters, they are still set in fantastical backgrounds. And yes, I know there's going to
be a Twilight 2000 4th ed by Free League Publishing (maybe the Swedes prefer more _realistic_ genres?)

Are we really that bored with reality as it is?  I often see in forums that people play games to "escape".  I get it.
Reality sucks, and life is hard.  But does that mean we have to run away from reality?  I even question the very idea
that games should only be about "fun".

Have you ever read a good book, watched a good movie, or saw a TV series that you felt made you question things, and
helped improve your life?  Exercise isn't "fun" for many people, at least while they are doing it, but it is something
that improves your life.  Why do we limit games as _just_ entertainment?  Why can't games be provocative and motivating,
making us think about things?  Roleplaying at its core is not entertainment, it's "what if?".

Perhaps I'm just an oddball.  In Buddhism, seeking happiness is not what we should strive for.  Rather we should seek
understanding, which in turn begets peace.  With happiness, like all things in life, it can be taken away from you.  If
you are able to find peace, it can't be taken from you.  For me, the role playing sessions I treasured were not like
fishing tales boasting of how with only 2 HP left, I was able to slay the dragon or defeat the Lich Lord.  They came
from small moments, like watching how players would react to a little Vietnamese running up to them.

It seems like we are all so desperate to feel special, to feel powerful in this crazy world, that we have forgotten that
we are all actually the same.  And that's a good thing, not a bad thing.

So this game's rules will always be about settings with little to no super or preternatural beings or powers.  You wont
find spell users, or force users, or even some guy who can climb into some exoskeleton power armor with the power to
demolish an entire tank company.  You will not see Elder Gods, 100 ton mecha, or wuxia jumping across tree tops.

What you will see, are down to earth characters, who like everyone else has to make decisions with the tools and
capabilities they have at hand.  If you think that sounds boring, then you are selling yourself short.
