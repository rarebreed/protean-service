# Combat

This section will go over the rules for handling combat in retro.  This will be divided up into four sections:

- General Combat
- Melee combat
- Ranged combat
- Mass combat
- Vehicular combat

## General Combat

All forms of combat are broken up into several steps:

1. Determine mental state and awareness
2. Determine distance and positioning between opponents
3. Choose action (in secret)
4. For beginning of combat only, determine initiative (starting count)
5. Reveal action
    - Character may decide to react by paying reaction time cost
5. Determine when actions will take place by adding action costs to starting count
6. For action that **finishes** first, determine task roll to get the grade
    - The opponent's task roll will be determined by what action he took
    - Apply any modifiers for the proactive opponent (wounds, fatigue, previous feint, etc)
    - Apply any effects **immediately**, for example determining damage and its effects
7. Pay fatigue cost of the action
8. Repeat steps 1-3 for the character that just finished his action
9. Once all participants have acted, proceed to steps 4-9

One of the most important concepts to understand for combat of any kind is the Action Economy

## Actions

Unlike most games that have an initiative phase which determines who gets to go in what order, retro takes its cue from
the woefully maligned Phoenix Command Combat System of the 1980s.  Actions have a cost, called a Count, which determines
how long it takes to perform the action.  Then of course, there are the actions themselves.

The act of deciding what Actions to take and calculating the cost is called the "Action Economy".  Knowing what Actions do
in order to choose one will be covered in the Actions section.

### Action Economy

In this system, every action has an Action Count.  This, and an added reaction cost (determined by your character's Wit,
Speed and Coolness) determines how long a particular action will take.  What matters more is not when an action
**starts** but when it **finishes**.  A character with a fast initiative who starts a slow action first, may wind up
completing his action _after_ a slower character begins a less costly action in terms of Action Counts.

```ignore
Tyco and Arna are fighting against 2 veteran Neo Janissaries.  All 4 antagonists will choose what they will first do.
Since they encountered each other 20' away, Arna decides to close with her opponent with a half move combined with a 
Strike.  Tyco, who has a spear, decides to half move and a Guard.  They each pay their Action Count cost (determined
by how many points they put into the Speed combat pool).  The actions are as follows:

- Tyco's Guard is fast and only takes 5 Counts
- Arna's Strike action takes 8 Counts total
- Janisary 1 chooses to Maneuver for 6 counts
- Janissary 2 choose a Strike for 7 counts 

Now they roll for initiative.  Tyco gets a 12, Arna a 14 and the Janissary 1 gets an 11 and Janissary 2 gets a 14.  
Since Arna and Janissary 2 got the highest initiatives, we start with their score of 14.  Tyco's difference is 2 (14 - 
12) and Janissary 1's difference is 3 (14 - 11).  So we wind up with a starting initiative phase of:

- 0: Arna and Janissary 2
- 2: Tyco
- 3: Janissary 1

Now we add the action count for each participant:

- Tyco: 2 + 5 = 7  (initiative start phase + action count)
- Arna: 0 + 8 = 8
- Janissary 1: 3 + 6 = 9
- Janissary 2: 0 + 8 = 8

To determine which actions to resolve, we look for the lowest initiative phase.  So Tyco gets to go first, since
his action will complete on phase 7.  Then it's a tie between Arna and Janissary 2 (broken by whomever has the higest
Speed) and lastly Janissary 1.

Tyco's actions will be resolved, and then he will begin at Step 1.
```

### Melee Actions

Melee combat is special in that the Action Count cost can vary depending on how exactly a manuever is performed.  The basic
Action types are listed here, but more detail is in the Melee section

### Mental state and awareness

Sometimes, it's easier to break an opponent's will than his body.  The mental state of an actor in combat is of vital
importance.  Fear, panic, rage, despair, all of these can affect not just performance, but even influence the decisions
the actor will make.  For example, a panicking character is very likely not going to move forward to press an attack.

To account for this, we need to consider the mental and emotional state of a participant in combat.  To do this, there
are several states each with associated benefits and drawbacks

| Name          | Condition                           | Attack | Defend | Fear | Actions
|---------------|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|------|----------------------
| Overconfident | Overzealous and dismissive of enemy | +2     | -1     | +2   | Can not Disengage or Retreat
| Confident     | Feels good about the odds           | +1     |        | +1   |
| Determined    | Last Stand, Sacrifice attitude      |        | +1     | Imm  | Can not Retreat
| Normal        | no bonuses or penalties             |        |        |      |
| Surprised     | Ambushed or caught unaware          | NA     | -2     | -1   | Can not attack yet
| Grim          | Seeing the odds not in favor        | -1     | +1     | -1   |
| Broken        | Confused and beginning to panic     | -1     | -1     | -1   |
| Panicked      | Frozen in fear                      | -3     | -2     | -2   | Can not initiate attacks
| Routing       | Full retreat                        | None   | None   | NA   | Only thought is to run away 
| Berserk       | Blind rage                          | +2     | -2     | Imm  | Must engage enemy


#### Overconfidence




## Melee Combat

Melee combat is any kind of non-ranged combat between a handful of combatants.  This includes, kicking, punching, 
swords, spears, grappling, etc.
