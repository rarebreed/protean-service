# Combat in retro

Because I have always been fond of simulation style games, combat is a large part of the design of retro.  Combat is
really just a specialized and detailed type of Task Resolution.  As in all Task Resolutions, it is a contested system.
Even ranged combat is a contested roll.

## Melee combat

Most combat in RPG's are not realistic or even narratively interesting at all.  Most games typically allow each
participant in the combat an equal number of actions and reactions.  And even games that let characters have more
actions than others still allow automatic defensive reactions, and generally apply an evenness to combat.

Character A attacks
NPC B blocks/dodges
NPC B attacks
Character A blocks/didges

This is not only unrealistic it is boring.  How many boxing matches or UFC fights do you see alternating like that?
None.  In the real world, opponents size each other up, and then unleash a flurry of attacks, stopping only to rest,
regain balance, or because the defender was able to counter and seize the initiative (for example, trapping the attack,
sweeping, or side stepping out of the line of attack).  Considerations of fatigue, distancing, aggressiveness and
looking for openings is almost never considered in games.  Most games dont factor in:

- What is the attack's reach?
- Distancing between opponents
- How fatiguing is it?
- How fast is the attack?
- How to take advantage of openings
- How to take advantage of telegraphing
- Simultaneous attacks
- Stability of an attack or defensive movement

What makes retro somewhat unique is that it revolves around a tactical pool that must be split among different
values.  Pick 3 out of 5:

- Guard: How open are you leaving yourself?
- Root: How stable vs mobile are you? (high means rooted)
- Accuracy: How precise is your attack/counter-attack/parry?
- Magnitude: How much force are you putting behind the attack or distance to your dodge/evasion?
- Speed: How fast is your attack/counter-attack/parry?

Remember this as GRAMS

### Guard

Guard is a measure of how open or vulnerable you leave yourself to a counterattack.  Fighters who go all out by 
definition practically, must expose himself in order to do an all out attack.  Reaching excessively, as in a lunge,
or winding up to deliver a powerful blow often leaves the attacker exposed.

A high rating means that the attacker gets a defensive bonus against counter attacks.

### Root

Many martial arts stress being rooted.  This is a measure of how hard it is to throw you off balance.  The higher your
root, the harder it becomes to be thrown, tripped, or knocked off balance.  Any movement required during an attack will
deduct from this score.  So for example, if you need to close in to range, the movement requires will be subtracted.

### Accuracy

Some strikes are wild while others require a more targeted area.  Many locks for example, require very precise location
in order to work correctly.  The rating here can be used to offset any targeting penalties.

From a defensive standpoint, accuracy implies blocking, parrying, or manuevering to a desired position (dodging for a 
tactical advantage)

### Magnitude

How much force is put into the attack, block, or movement for an evasion.  Attacks can be light (think about a jab) or
punishing (think of a haymaker).  The same goes defensively.  Defending a heavy attack by a 2 handed weapon either 
requires a strong block also, or finesse with a parry.  Dodges may also require greater magnitude representing a larger
distance moved to evade (imagine dodging a spear for example or a whip chain)

### Speed

How quickly you pull off a maneuver is determined by how much speed you put behind it.  The higher this rating, the 
less Phases it takes to complete and also the harder it becomes to block or dodge.

From a defensive viewpoint, a quick block is needed to defend a quick attack.  Also, a fast 

## Techniques

Every melee combat is defined by a techniques.  Techniques can be offensive, defensive, or both in nature. Many
defensive moves can actually be considered counter attacks.  For example, blocks, traps, or disarms can be considered
defensive moves which can damage the attacker.  A defense is therefore a reactionary technique, whereas an offensive
move is an active technique.  So a move which may seem defensive, like a manuever (which can double as an evade) is
actually an offensive technique, and not defensive.

| Offense     |
|-------------|---------------------|
| strike      |
| grab        |
| throw       |
| 

Offense:

- SAM: Hitting hard, fast and accurate, but poorly rooted and guarded (think lunging punch, or flying kick)
- SAG: Fast accurate guarded strike, but not rooted or powerful (quick snap quick)
- SAR: Fast accurate and rooted, but not powerful or guarded (flurry of jabs)
- SMG: Fast powerful and guarded, but not accurate or rooted (flying knee or spinning kick)
- SMR: Fast powerful and rooted, but open wide and inaccurate (hook, roundhouse)
- SGR: Fast, guarded, rooted, but not powerful or accurate  (quick weaving jab)
- AMG: Accurate, powerful and guarded, but not fast or rooted (knee kick)
- AMR: Accurate powerful and stable, but not fast or guarded (haymaker)
- AGR: 
- MGR:

Defense:

- SAM: quick leap out of the way to maneuver beneficially
- SAG: Fast accurate stable strike, but not rooted or powerful (quick snap quick)
- SAR: Fast accurate and rooted, but not powerful or guarded (flurry of jabs)
- SMG: Fast powerful and guarded, but not accurate or rooted (flying knee or spinning kick)
- SMR: Fast powerful and rooted, but open wide and inaccurate (hook, roundhouse)
- SGR: Fast, guarded, rooted, but not powerful or accurate  (quick weaving jab)
- AMG: Accurate, powerful and guarded, but not fast or rooted (knee kick)

### Combat mode

A combatant will start with a mode.

- Disengaging: Trying to flee combat
- Defensive: Concentrating on defending and looking for openings
- Opportunistic: 
- Offensive
- Aggressive



Ranged:

- Speed (aim time)
- Stance
- Awareness
