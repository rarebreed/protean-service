# Combat in retro

Because I have always been fond of simulation style games, combat is a large part of the design of retro.  Combat is
really just a specialized and detailed type of Task Resolution.  As in all Task Resolutions, it is a contested system.
Even ranged combat is a contested roll.

## Aspects of combat

Most games only factor in skill of the adversaries, how fast they are, weapon damage and armor. They either don't
consider, or have many of these aspects of combat bolted on in a very ad-hoc manner

- Morale: If you are scared, you aren't going to be as effective
- Aggressiveness: "It's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog"
- Fatigue: It doesn't matter how skilled you are, if you are too tired to move
- Damage: Wounds, concussions, broken limbs, pain and other damage effects can drastically reduce effectiveness
- Reach: If your weapon can't reach your target, you have to get into range (which can be difficult and takes time)
- Time: How fast does your (re)action take?  A jab will connect faster than a spinning round house
- Reliability: Especially for modern weapons, how prone is your weapon to failure?

Some will argue that this is too much minutae to keep track of, and will bog down the "fun" of the game.  I will argue
that without consideration of these elements, the narrative value of the action is lost, and perhaps worse, the
unrealism will tar victories with a poor brush.  I will also argue that many systems _do_ address many of the above
aspects, but do so in an ad-hoc bolted on and therefore incongruous way.  If it is done smartly, I believe that all the
above can be factored in and make combat much more visceral and even exciting, exactly because it is more realistic.


## Design philosophy of combat in retro

Most combat in RPG's are not realistic or even narratively interesting at all.  Most games typically allow each
participant in the combat an equal number of actions and reactions.  And even games that let characters have more
actions than others still allow automatic defensive reactions, and generally apply an evenness to combat.

```
Character A attacks
NPC B blocks/dodges
NPC B attacks
Character A blocks/didges
```

This is not only unrealistic it is boring.  How many boxing matches or UFC fights do you see alternating like that?
None.  In the real world, opponents size each other up, and then unleash a flurry of attacks, stopping only to rest,
regain balance, or because the defender was able to counter and seize the initiative (for example, trapping the attack,
sweeping, or side stepping out of the line of attack).  Or maybe one combatant only throws out an exploratory jab or
thrust, perhaps as a feint, or perhaps to judge his opponents reflexes, and the other combatant may still just hold, 
waiting for an opening to attack...or maybe escape.  

Many fans of other game systems will simply tell you that all of the above _is_ happening in those games, and the turn
and initiative system simply abstracts it away.  In other words, a roll of the dice doesn't reflect a _single_ blow or a
single defense, but the rolls are an abstraction of one or more attacks or defenses, and the result of the dice is the
sum effect of the actions.  And yet, how often is the narrative described that way?  Also, even if the above is true,
why does each side effectively always get to attack and defend?  That is not how real fights work, as when you hear in
boxing "he's got him on the ropes", "he's on his last legs", "the enemy has seized the initiative", "the enemy is on the
run", etc etc.

The way virtually every combat system works, is the assailants stand their ground, and trade blow for blow until someone
gets a good shot in (ie, a good dice roll).  And if you argue that the combat is abstracted away, and the combatants are
jockeying for advantageous position, sizing each other up, stepping back to take a breath etc, how often is that
actually described?  I argue that you have just abstracted not only half of the fun away (tactical decision making) but
also half the storytelling and half the reward of victory (by making good choices, rather than letting the dice abstract
it away).  Wouldn't you rather actually make those distinctions _in the game rules_ rather than (forget) to make them up
as flowery description?

The most common argument against such crunchy rules, is that it makes combat take longer and thus takes away from the
story by focusing too much time on combat.  Though combat will take more time due to this level of simulation, I feel it
is a worthwhile trade.  As I mentioned earlier, I think it is actually better for storytelling than the too abstracted
combat systems of other games.  I also will argue that victory will feel more sweet, because you have put more thought
and effort into it.  I will also argue that combat may not take as much time as other systems, because combat in retro
will be more lethal or at least render characters hors de combat much faster than most games.  While simulating the
action may take longer, successful hits will be more brutal than most games (especially ones using hit points) and thus
combatants will be taken out of combat with fewer hits (often just one).

```
Side rant: hit points

The popularity of that other game has made the notion of hit points ubiquitous. It also strains versimilitude to the
breaking point when you have an assassination, coup de grace, or some other situation where a high hit point character
should be killed very easily.  The old tired excuse is that hit points reflect skill and fortitude of more experienced
characters, who are therefore able to turn a mighty blow into, essentially a scratch.  But over time, due to fatigue
and "luck running out", eventually even very experienced characters will eventually succumb to their wounds.

This is horse crock.  Why then are their rules about number of hit points healed per day?  So it takes longer for a 
character with high hit points to be healed because....it takes longer to heal their luck?  It's an abstraction so 
leaky, that a little Dutch boy would feel at home.  But, because it has such a long hold in the industry, that most
players dont give it a second thought.

Some game systems have moved away from Hit Points, or at least a single "bag" of HP.  In retro, HP is replaced the 
notion of damage tracks, with different kinds of damage.  It also pays a lot of attention to conditions and affects of
damage types.
```

Considerations of fatigue, distancing, aggressiveness, morale, psychology and looking for openings is almost never
considered in games.  Retro is different, and many subtleties of combat are considered.  Most games dont factor in:

- What is the attack's reach?
- Distancing between opponents
- Facing or positioning of opponents
- How fatiguing is the maneuver?
- How fast will the attack hit (not who started first)?
- How to take advantage of openings
- How to take advantage of telegraphing
- Simultaneous attacks
- Stability of an attack or defensive movement
- Motivation to fight
- Emotional state

## Psychological state of combat

Combat is greatly affected by the psychological state of the fighters.  The fighter's mind and will to fight will often
be defeated before the body.

### Motivation

Fighters who have nothing to lose or are in a vengeful mood will be less affected by morale than fighters who don't know
why they are fighting or have nothing to gain.  If you are fighting to save your home country, or acting as a fighting 
rear guard to allow your comrades to escape, you will be much

**TODO** What are the game mechanics for this?

### Mental state

Some people are just more aggressive or violent than others.  Others are just more scrappy, and have a love of fighting.
As Churchill famously said, "It's not the size of the dog in the fight, but the size of the fight in the dog".
Conversely, some people are timid, meek, or even cowardly, and either have no heart to harm others, or are scared too
afraid of harm being done to themselves.

Essentially, aggressiveness is the balance or ratio of desire to do harm to others, vs willingness to be harmed.  The
higher this ratio is, the more you want to "dish it out".  The lower this ratio, the more defensive you become.  Notice
the use of the words _desire_ and _willing_.  A character may be very willing and able to do harm to other NPCs, but
may not have a particular _desire_ to do so.  

Aggressiveness is rated as Harm Other/Self Protection.  If you have a low Protect:Self, then it means you are more
willing to sacrifice yourself or commit harm upon yourself to achieve some goal.  Think for example of suicide bombers
or kamikaze pilots.  Also think for example, of a berserker fighting alone on a bridge to buy time for his fellows to
escape.

#### How the balance changes

This is where a Character's psyche and personality traits come into play.  Rage can drastically simultaneously increase
both Harm:Other and lower Self:Protect.  Selfishness or cowardly traits can also drastically raise Self:Protect and
reduce Harm:Other.  Being wounded typically puts one into survival mode, thus increasing Self:Protect.

Training, discipline and personality traits can affect when and how much these values change.

| Trigger              | Check  
|----------------------|--------
| Being wounded        |
| Good friend wounded  | 
| Loved one attacked   |
| Loved one wounded    |
| Insulted             |
| Humiliated
| 

**TODO** What are the game mechanics for this?

### Morale

We all would like to think our character would bravely face down a horde of orcs, enemy soldiers or whatever your
nemesis happens to be.  But the fact is, having a character essentially be immune to fear cheapens the very heroism
they are supposed to have.  Nothing is valuable without sacrifice...and this includes having to pay for overcoming one's
fears.

Many factors can play into morale.  A substantial part of morale comes from:

- Psyche: your personality traits (especially egocentricity)
- Principles: how you believe you should live your life
- Training: A sense of duty and obligation, or cultural way of life

If your homeland or town is being razed to the ground, it can throw thoughts of one's own death to the winds if you are
the type that is patriotic or humanitarian.  If your character is the self-centered type (a very high ego) your
character may feel that everyone else is unimportant except one's own skin.

Morale is lowered under several circumstances:

| Trigger                      | Effect
|------------------------------|------------
| 25% of your party is down    | -1
| 50% of your party is down    | -2
| 75% of your party is down    | -3
| outnumbered 2 to 1           | -1
| outnumbered 3 to 1           | -2  
| outnumbered > 4 to 1         | -3
| leader is unreachable        | -1
| headquarters is overrun      | -3
| (Modern) down to 20% ammo    | -2
| attacks are doing nothing    | -3
| start out fatigued           | -1

### Base morale

Morale is determined by:

```

```

### Conditions of morale

There are 5 conditions of morale

- High: You and your team is eager and ready to attack.  Advantage to aggression
- Steady: The default condition.  Your character is ready and willing to fight and be agressive.
- Wavering: You are holding and can still attack, but penalty to aggression and offensive attacks
- Broken: You can no longer attack and must withdraw.  Can perform covering fire/supression only
- Panic: Full blown route, your only action is to turn your back and flee

When you have **High** morale, your character is chomping at the bit to fight.  There is a +1 bonus for aggressive
actions (taking the fight to the enemy to try to put them off guard)

For **Steady** morale, your character is in the fight and equally capable of both offensive and defensive techniques.

At **Wavering** morale, your character is starting to wonder if they are going to lose.  There is a -1 bonus for any
offensive techniques, and the character switches to a defensive mode.

At **Broken** morale, your character will try to disengage from combat in the most effective way possible. No actively
offensive techniques are possible.  If attacked physically, the character can perform passively offensive maneuvers
(counter blocks, trips, disarms, throws, etc), but at a -2 rating.  Dodges and other maneuver-to-position moves are
possible without any ill-effects.

When in **Panic**, the character must flee at the maximum speed possible.  This even means turning one's back to the
enemy!  A roll can be made here to surrender to see if the character realizes that is hopeless (eg the enemy can move
faster than he can).

### Rolling for morale

**TODO** how does game mechanics work for morale?


## Melee combat

Melee combat is different from ranged combat in many ways.  The in your face nature of melee combat is not only
different in terms of tactics and training, but also psychologically.  This section goes into detail about how to run
melee combats

### Tactical choices: GRAMS

What makes retro somewhat unique is that it revolves around a tactical pool that must be split among different
values.  Pick 3 out of 5:

- Guard: How open are you leaving yourself?
- Root: How stable vs mobile are you? (high means rooted and less mobile)
- Accuracy: How precise is your maneuver?
- Magnitude: How much force are you putting behind the attack or distance to your dodge/evasion?
- Speed: How fast is your maneuver?

Remember this as GRAMS

### Guard

Guard is a measure of how open or vulnerable you leave yourself to a counterattack.  Fighters who go all out, by 
definition practically, must expose themselves in order to do an all out attack.  Reaching excessively, as in a lunge,
or winding up to deliver a powerful blow often leaves the attacker exposed.

A high rating means that the attacker gets a defensive bonus against counter attacks.

**TODO** Flesh out the game mechanics

### Root

Many martial arts stress being rooted.  This is a measure of how hard it is to throw you off balance.  The higher your
root, the harder it becomes to be thrown, tripped, or knocked off balance.  Any movement required during an attack will
deduct from this score.  So for example, if you need to close in to range, the movement required will be subtracted.

It is difficult therefore to be both mobile, and rooted.  On one hand, you gain a defensive bonus to being tripped,
thrown, or grappled, but the score here is also a penalty against evasion technique (ie, evading a grenade)

### Accuracy

Some strikes are wild while others require a more targeted area.  Many locks for example, require very precise location
in order to work correctly.  The rating here can be used to offset any targeting penalties.

From a defensive standpoint, accuracy implies blocking, parrying, or manuevering to a desired position (dodging for a 
tactical advantage).  Adding accuracy to a positioning manuever, will for example become a bonus for the next attack.

### Magnitude

How much force is put into the attack, block, or movement for an evasion.  Attacks can be light (think about a jab) or
punishing (think of a haymaker).  The same goes defensively.  Defending a heavy attack by a 2 handed weapon either 
requires a strong block also, or finesse with a parry.  Dodges may also require greater magnitude representing a larger
distance moved to evade (imagine dodging a spear for example or a whip chain)

### Speed

How quickly you pull off a maneuver is determined by how much speed you put behind it.  The higher this rating, the 
less Phases it takes to complete and also the harder it becomes to block or dodge.

From a defensive viewpoint, a quick block is needed to defend a quick attack.

## Techniques

Every melee combat is defined by a techniques.  Techniques can be offensive, defensive, or both in nature. Many
defensive moves can actually be considered counter attacks.  For example, blocks, traps, or disarms can be considered
defensive moves which can damage the attacker.  A defense is therefore a reactionary technique, whereas an offensive
move is an active technique.  So a move which may seem defensive, like a manuever (which can double as an evade) is
actually an offensive technique, and not defensive.

| Offense     |
|-------------|---------------------|
| strike      |
| grab        |
| throw       |
| 

Offense:

- SAM: Hitting hard, fast and accurate, but poorly rooted and guarded (think lunging punch, or flying kick)
- SAG: Fast accurate guarded strike, but not rooted or powerful (quick snap quick)
- SAR: Fast accurate and rooted, but not powerful or guarded (flurry of jabs)
- SMG: Fast powerful and guarded, but not accurate or rooted (flying knee or spinning kick)
- SMR: Fast powerful and rooted, but open wide and inaccurate (hook, roundhouse)
- SGR: Fast, guarded, rooted, but not powerful or accurate  (quick weaving jab)
- AMG: Accurate, powerful and guarded, but not fast or rooted (knee kick)
- AMR: Accurate powerful and stable, but not fast or guarded (haymaker)
- AGR: 
- MGR:

Defense:

- SAM: quick leap out of the way to maneuver beneficially
- SAG: Fast accurate stable strike, but not rooted or powerful (quick snap quick)
- SAR: Fast accurate and rooted, but not powerful or guarded (flurry of jabs)
- SMG: Fast powerful and guarded, but not accurate or rooted (flying knee or spinning kick)
- SMR: Fast powerful and rooted, but open wide and inaccurate (hook, roundhouse)
- SGR: Fast, guarded, rooted, but not powerful or accurate  (quick weaving jab)
- AMG: Accurate, powerful and guarded, but not fast or rooted (knee kick)
- AMR: Accurate powerful and stable, but not fast or guarded (haymaker)
- AGR: 
- MGR:

### Combat mode

A combatant will start with a mode.

- Disengaging: Trying to flee combat
- Defensive: Concentrating on defending and looking for openings
- Opportunistic: 
- Offensive
- Aggressive

## Ranged combat

Ranged:

- Speed (aim time)
- Stance
- Awareness
