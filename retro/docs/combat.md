# Combat in retro

Because I have always been fond of simulation style games, combat is a large part of the design of retro.  Combat is
really just a specialized and detailed type of Task Resolution.  As in all Task Resolutions, it is a contested system.
Even ranged combat is a contested roll.

What makes retro somewhat unique is that it revolves around a tactical pool that must be split among 3 different
values.  These different 

Physical:

- Speed/Accuracy
- Power
- Stability/Openness

Ranged:

- Speed (aim time)
- Stance
- Awareness
