# Combat in retro

Because I have always been fond of simulation style games, combat is a large part of the design of retro.  Combat is
really just a specialized and detailed type of Task Resolution.  As in all Task Resolutions, it is a contested system.
Even ranged combat is a contested roll.

## Aspects of combat

Most games only factor in skill of the adversaries, how fast they are, weapon damage and armor. They either don't
consider, or have many of these aspects of combat bolted on in a very ad-hoc manner

- Morale: If you are scared, you aren't going to be as effective
- Aggressiveness: "It's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog"
- Fatigue: It doesn't matter how skilled you are, if you are too tired to move
- Damage: Wounds, concussions, broken limbs, pain and other damage effects can drastically reduce effectiveness
- Reach: If your weapon can't reach your target, you have to get into range (which can be difficult and takes time)
- Time: How fast does your (re)action take?  A jab will connect faster than a spinning round house
- Reliability: Especially for modern weapons, how prone is your weapon to failure?

Some will argue that this is too much minutae to keep track of, and will bog down the "fun" of the game.  I will argue
that without consideration of these elements, the narrative value of the action is lost, and perhaps worse, the
unrealism will tar victories with a poor brush.  I will also argue that many systems _do_ address many of the above
aspects, but do so in an ad-hoc bolted on and therefore incongruous way.  If it is done smartly, I believe that all the
above can be factored in and make combat much more visceral and even exciting, exactly because it is more realistic.

## Morale

We all would like to think our character would bravely face down a horde of orcs, enemy soldiers or whatever your
nemesis happens to be.  But the fact is, having a character essentially be immune to fear cheapens the very heroism
they are supposed to have.  Nothing is valuable without sacrifice...and this includes having to pay for overcoming one's
fears.

Many factors can play into morale.  A substantial part of morale comes from:

- Psyche: your personality traits (especially egocentricity)
- Principles: how you believe you should live your life
- Training: A sense of duty and obligation, or cultural way of life

If your homeland or town is being razed to the ground, it can throw thoughts of one's own death to the winds if you are
the type that is patriotic or humanitarian.  If your character is the self-centered type (a very high ego) your
character may feel that everyone else is unimportant except one's own skin.

Morale is lowered under several circumstances:

- When 25% of your party is down
- When 50% of your party is down
- When 75% of your party is down
- When you are outnumbered 2 to 1 (in terms of equivalent strength, not just quanity)
- When you are outnumbered 3 to 1
- When you are outnumbered 4 or more to 1
- When your leader is taken out or unreachable
- When your headquarters is overrun
- (For modern) when you are down to 20% ammunition
- When your most powerful attacks are (apparently) doing nothing
- When you start out fatigued

### Base morale

Morale is determined by:

```

```

### Conditions of morale

There are 5 conditions of morale

- High: You and your team is eager and ready to attack.  Advantage to aggression
- Steady: The default condition.  Your character is ready and willing to fight and be agressive.
- Wavering: You are holding and can still attack, but penalty to aggression and offensive attacks
- Broken: You can no longer attack and must withdraw.  Can perform covering fire/supression only
- Panic: Full blown route, your only action is to turn your back and flee

When you have **High** morale, your character is chomping at the bit to fight.  There is a +1 bonus for aggressive
actions (taking the fight to the enemy to try to put them off guard)

For **Steady** morale, your character is in the fight and equally capable of both offensive and defensive techniques.

At **Wavering** morale, your character is starting to wonder if they are going to lose.  There is a -1 bonus for any
offensive techniques, and the character switches to a defensive mode.

At **Broken** morale, your character will try to disengage from combat in the most effective way possible. No actively
offensive techniques are possible.  If attacked physically, the character can perform passively offensive maneuvers
(counter blocks, trips, disarms, throws, etc), but at a -2 rating.  Dodges and other maneuver-to-position moves are
possible without any ill-effects.

When in **Panic**, the character must flee at the maximum speed possible.  This even means turning one's back to the
enemy!  A roll can be made here to surrender to see if the character realizes that is hopeless (eg the enemy can move
faster than he can).

### Rolling for morale



## Melee combat

Most combat in RPG's are not realistic or even narratively interesting at all.  Most games typically allow each
participant in the combat an equal number of actions and reactions.  And even games that let characters have more
actions than others still allow automatic defensive reactions, and generally apply an evenness to combat.

Character A attacks
NPC B blocks/dodges
NPC B attacks
Character A blocks/didges

This is not only unrealistic it is boring.  How many boxing matches or UFC fights do you see alternating like that?
None.  In the real world, opponents size each other up, and then unleash a flurry of attacks, stopping only to rest,
regain balance, or because the defender was able to counter and seize the initiative (for example, trapping the attack,
sweeping, or side stepping out of the line of attack).  Considerations of fatigue, distancing, aggressiveness and
looking for openings is almost never considered in games.  Most games dont factor in:

- What is the attack's reach?
- Distancing between opponents
- How fatiguing is it?
- How fast is the attack?
- How to take advantage of openings
- How to take advantage of telegraphing
- Simultaneous attacks
- Stability of an attack or defensive movement

What makes retro somewhat unique is that it revolves around a tactical pool that must be split among different
values.  Pick 3 out of 5:

- Guard: How open are you leaving yourself?
- Root: How stable vs mobile are you? (high means rooted)
- Accuracy: How precise is your attack/counter-attack/parry?
- Magnitude: How much force are you putting behind the attack or distance to your dodge/evasion?
- Speed: How fast is your attack/counter-attack/parry?

Remember this as GRAMS

### Guard

Guard is a measure of how open or vulnerable you leave yourself to a counterattack.  Fighters who go all out by 
definition practically, must expose himself in order to do an all out attack.  Reaching excessively, as in a lunge,
or winding up to deliver a powerful blow often leaves the attacker exposed.

A high rating means that the attacker gets a defensive bonus against counter attacks.

### Root

Many martial arts stress being rooted.  This is a measure of how hard it is to throw you off balance.  The higher your
root, the harder it becomes to be thrown, tripped, or knocked off balance.  Any movement required during an attack will
deduct from this score.  So for example, if you need to close in to range, the movement requires will be subtracted.

### Accuracy

Some strikes are wild while others require a more targeted area.  Many locks for example, require very precise location
in order to work correctly.  The rating here can be used to offset any targeting penalties.

From a defensive standpoint, accuracy implies blocking, parrying, or manuevering to a desired position (dodging for a 
tactical advantage)

### Magnitude

How much force is put into the attack, block, or movement for an evasion.  Attacks can be light (think about a jab) or
punishing (think of a haymaker).  The same goes defensively.  Defending a heavy attack by a 2 handed weapon either 
requires a strong block also, or finesse with a parry.  Dodges may also require greater magnitude representing a larger
distance moved to evade (imagine dodging a spear for example or a whip chain)

### Speed

How quickly you pull off a maneuver is determined by how much speed you put behind it.  The higher this rating, the 
less Phases it takes to complete and also the harder it becomes to block or dodge.

From a defensive viewpoint, a quick block is needed to defend a quick attack.  Also, a fast 

## Techniques

Every melee combat is defined by a techniques.  Techniques can be offensive, defensive, or both in nature. Many
defensive moves can actually be considered counter attacks.  For example, blocks, traps, or disarms can be considered
defensive moves which can damage the attacker.  A defense is therefore a reactionary technique, whereas an offensive
move is an active technique.  So a move which may seem defensive, like a manuever (which can double as an evade) is
actually an offensive technique, and not defensive.
